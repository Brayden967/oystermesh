Oyster

The Oyster mesh protocol provides:

- Decentralized and immutable data storage, hosting, retrieval and sharing.
- Automated geolocation-aware load balancing of data.
- Proof of Latency (PoL) anti-spam mechanism has low and sustainable CPU/energy requirements.
- Implicitly DDOS-proof data hosting, service denial requires physical proximity to the dataâ€™s location whilst the location is obfuscated.
- Built-in redundancy algorithm maintains data integrity without counter-party risk.
- Secure and untraceable access to data like a decentralized VPN.
- Decentralized application (dApp) platform to run immutable JavaScript code.
- Peer-to-peer topology forms a node mesh which can circumvent centralized legacy communication lines.
- Efficient data routing between any devices across the mesh via intelligent sector routing algorithm.
- IoT-compatible ultra-low power consumption, anti-spam and integrity-upkeep mechanisms consume network bandwidth instead of CPU cycles.
- Decentralized GPS (DGPS) system allows trust-less location triangulation.
- Decentralized .mesh domain name resolving system.
