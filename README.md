# Oyster

Bandwidth Bound Consensus.

## The Mesh

The Oyster Mesh Protocol provides:

- Decentralized and immutable data storage, hosting, retrieval and sharing.
- Akoya: a peer-to-peer decentralized, deflationary currency with a 20 second confirmation time, sustainable low-energy consumption, no mining, and no transaction fees. 
- Automated geolocation-aware load balancing of data.
- Proof of Latency (PoL) anti-spam mechanism has low and sustainable CPU/energy requirements.
- Implicitly DDOS-proof data hosting; service denial requires physical proximity to the dataâ€™s location whilst the location is obfuscated.
- Built-in redundancy algorithm maintains data integrity without counter-party risk.
- Secure and untraceable access to data like a decentralized VPN.
- Decentralized application (dApp) platform to run immutable JavaScript code.
- Peer-to-peer topology forms a node mesh which can circumvent centralized legacy communication lines.
- Efficient data routing between any devices across the mesh via swarm intelligence.
- IoT-compatible ultra-low power consumption; anti-spam and integrity-upkeep mechanisms consume network bandwidth instead of CPU cycles.
- Decentralized GPS (DGPS) system allows trust-less location triangulation.
- Decentralized .mesh domain name resolving system.

## Data Push/Pull Example
Required files are oysterdepend.js (dependencies like PeerJS) and oystermesh.js (protocol logic):

```
<script src="oysterdepend.js"></script>
<script src="oystermesh.js"></script>
```
Example for pushing and then pulling data to/from the Oyster mesh:
```
function render(superhandle, data) {
    alert(data);//alert the data pulled from the mesh
}

function example() {
    let glue_count = 0;//track how many times the data has been stored on the mesh
    let callback = function() {//this callback is called when a data nonce (part) is confirmed as deposited on the mesh
        glue_count++;
        if (glue_count>=5) {//stop pushing when the data has been stored 5+ times on the mesh
            window.OY_DATA_PUSH[handle] = false;//stop pushing the data to the mesh by referencing the handle (data ID only, no decryption key included)
            oy_data_pull(superhandle, render);//pull the data from the mesh by referencing the superhandle (data ID + decryption key)
        }
    };

    let superhandle = oy_data_push("EXAMPLE-DATA-HERE", callback);//call protocol function to push data to mesh
    let handle = superhandle.split("@")[0].substr(0, 46);//superhandle is the key to identify and unlock the data, handle skips the decryption part and is used to manage threads
}

oy_init(example);//run example after oyster initializes via callback
```

## Browser Support

### Firefox

Firefox is the best browser to run Oyster. Connections are stable and CPU usage is minimal. I have noticed that, rarely, Oyster will run sluggishly after 12+ hrs of running continuously in Firefox and restarting the browser is the only solution. Make sure to use the latest stable version of Firefox.

### Chrome

Chrome runs Oyster fine for 1 hour or less. There is a known bug in chrome that affects all webrtc projects: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=825576. This bug will cause new webrtc connections to fail after ~1.5hrs of continuous use without a refresh. Otherwise Chrome works fine albiet with slightly heavier CPU usage than Firefox.

### Safari

Oyster runs fine in Safari on both macOS and iOS devices. However, I have noticed a bug where after some heavy usage your node will become unable to make new connections, and only restarting the browser solves the problem. The front-end interface has not been optimized for mobile devices so it may render somewhat inelegantly. Files downloads, including those of private keys, have not been tested extensively.
